        <h2 style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12)" class="blog-subtitle">Story</h2>
        <p>God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta, but over 13 years after the events of God of War; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army.

            Kratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos.
            
            After a protracted conflict with the metal giant that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the statue.
            
            Kratos realizes he must retrieve the Blade of Olympus to save himself. As he slowly gets up and limps his way to the sword, Zeus reveals himself as the Eagle that stole his power, and he betrayed Kratos so that his fate will not be the same as Ares'. Zeus then stabs the Blade of Olympus into Kratos' chest, killing him after he refuses to forever serve the Gods.
            
            However, as Kratos is being dragged towards an eternity of torment in the Underworld, he is saved by Gaia, the mother of the Titans and the franchise's narrator, who offers an alliance. Gaia tells the story of Zeus and how Cronos, Zeus' father, ate all of his children to prevent the prophecy that one of his own children would rise against him and how Rhea, Zeus' mother, saved her child and sent him away to an island that was really Gaia, the Titaness Mother of Earth and Zeus' grandmother, and Gaia nurtured Zeus until he grew to be a man and sought revenge against Cronos and all the Titans. As the Great War between the Gods and the Titans emerged, Zeus soon created a powerful weapon called the Blade of Olympus to end the Great War and with the Blade he banished the Titans to the depths of Tartarus.
            
            When the Titans were defeated by the Gods, they were punished and humiliated, and they want Kratos' help to exact revenge. Kratos escapes the Underworld and is bidden by Gaia to find the Sisters of Fate in order to change his past and avert his betrayal and kill Zeus. She gives Kratos the aid of the magical horse Pegasus to traverse the distance to the Sisters.
            
            Kratos and Pegasus, after a detour to a mountain that houses the Titan Typhon and the former Titan Prometheus, start flying towards The Island of Creation, but are again attacked by Griffins and Ravens, aided by the Dark Rider. The Dark Rider succeeds in slamming into Pegasus, sending the horse plummeting to its death, but Kratos counter-attacks by jumping onto The Dark Griffin, killing the Dark Rider with the Spear of Destiny, and killing the Dark Griffin by lodging the spear in its neck, as Kratos dives to the Island of Creation below.
            
            As he explores the island, Kratos encounters the likes of Theseus, from whom he kills and gains the Horse Keeper's Key and the Steeds of Time (a gift to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos in an attempt to change his own fate), Perseus, whom he savagely kills and takes his reflective shield to progress, the captain from the ship in the beginning of the God of War, and the Barbarian King whom he decapitated in the original God of War, from whom he takes the Barbarian Hammer. Kratos also encounters a haggard and crazed Icarus, whom he takes the Icarus' Wings from, and the Gorgon queen Euryale, from whom he gained the Head of Euryale by decapitating.
            
            Kratos lands upon the Titan Atlas below the earth and tries to communicate with him. At first Atlas resents the sight of the Spartan and refuses to help Kratos, bent on crushing the human for his new imprisonment since their last meeting in God of War: Chains of Olympus. However, Kratos manages to persuade Atlas to help him so that he may change his fate and kill Zeus. With the Titan accepting the offer, he grants Kratos a new power called the Atlas Quake and helps him back to the surface so that he may continue his quest. After reaching the surface he kills the Kraken and reawakens the Phoenix to fly towards the Temple of Fates with his desire for revenge for Zeus and a knowledge of Zeus destroying Sparta acts as an anger that helps him continue his quest. Finally reaching the Throne Room, Kratos expresses his firm desire to change his own fate, and that of Zeus, the King of the Gods of Olympus, after which the Sisters deny him passage through. Kratos then confronts Lahkesis.
            
            After a gruesome battle, Kratos stands witness as the middle sister Atropos comes forth from within the defeated Lahkesis, taking Kratos back in time, to the very moment of his battle with Ares. Planning on cutting his life short by destroying the Blade of the Gods, Kratos interferes by defending the Blade of the Gods, thus keeping the way things originally were. He soon defeats Atropos before traveling back to the present time while leaving Atropos trapped in a mirror. Now fighting both Lahkesis and Atropos at the same time, Kratos manages to stab the two Sisters with his blades and destroy the mirror they are trapped in. Thus, killing them by erasing the sisters out of existence.
            
            Kratos then makes his way to the remaining sister, Clotho, who operates and defends the Loom of Fate, which rules the lives of mortals and Gods alike. Pinning Clotho's hands to the ground, Kratos manages to impale her skull with a giant swinging blade-like pendulum, killing the final sister. With the destruction of the three Sisters of Fates, Kratos granted himself control over the Loom and his own destiny. He goes back to his death at Zeus' hands in Rhodes, saving his past self and reclaiming the Blade of Olympus from a surprised Zeus, inciting a lengthy battle with the King of the Gods. At the end of the fight, Zeus stuns Kratos with a powerful lighting storm, Kratos then announces untruthfully that he surrenders. As Zeus is about to kill Kratos, he deflects the blow using an energy blast and pins Zeus's hands to the rock with The Blades of Athena. Kratos then takes the Blade of Olympus and begins driving it into Zeus' chest.
            
            Before he could finish, Athena arrives and defends Zeus, however, Kratos is angered by her interference as Athena announces her intentions to protect Olympus. The badly wounded Zeus attempts to escape, while stating Kratos has started a war he can't possibly win. However, Kratos breaks free of the defending Athena, charging towards Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. A stunned Kratos asks her why she did this as the dying goddess reveals that Zeus' actions are meant to break the cycle of son killing father, which goes back to Cronos defeating Uranus, and Zeus defeating Cronos. By killing Kratos before he can kill him, Zeus had hoped to break the cycle - thus confirming that Kratos is, in fact, Zeus' own son, she begs him to relent in his quest for vengeance.
            
            After a moment of apparent shock and shame, Kratos darkens and snarls that he has no father. Athena dies in Kratos' arms, saying that all the Gods on Olympus will deny Kratos, defending Zeus so Olympus will prevail. She said that even though Kratos wishes to kill Zeus, Zeus is Olympus. Kratos then vows to exact retribution on Zeus and any God who will deny him his vengeance, saying that their time is at an end. The dead Athena's body soon explodes as Gaia speaks to Kratos and reminds him that he has the power to control time itself.
            
            Kratos returns to the Loom, as the room its in collapses around him and he goes back in time once more to the Great War of the Gods and Titans. He calls to Gaia and she announces that the Titans were expecting him and then Kratos explains they can win the Great War in his time.
            
            As a defeated Zeus encourages his fellow Gods to help him kill the now rogue Kratos, every single Titan to ever exist returns to Kratos' time in their prime forms (Due to Kratos going back in time to when all of the Titan were at their strongest to give Kratos his best chance of winning), angry and vengeful they climb Mount Olympus to kill Zeus and the Gods. Leading them, Kratos announces to Zeus "Zeus! Your son has returned, I bring the destruction of Olympus!!!", thus leading directly into the events of God of War III.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12)" class="blog-subtitle">Characters</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kratos: The main protagonist of the game. At the start of God of War II, Kratos is the God of War after defeating Ares but not being released from his torment made his sorrow boil into hatred and anger for the Gods. He turns to his mortal army of Sparta to wage war on cities across the lands of Greece, which raises the anger of Zeus and the other gods. Soon, he finds he is betrayed by Zeus and reduced to a mortal and his powers are taken away from him. Kratos must then travel to the Sisters of Fate to exact revenge, take back his godly powers and destroy Zeus once and for all.</li>
                <li>Athena: The goddess of wisdom, defensive war and industry, and the deuteragonist. Though a constant companion in the first game, Athena only appears three times; to warn Kratos his actions are displeasing the other gods, while channeling herself through a statue, and to save Zeus by stepping in the way of Kratos' killing blow.</li>
                <li>Gaia: Mother of the Titans, and connected to all things of the Earth and life. Along with the other Titans, she was banished in the War of the Titans, and seeing Kratos' quest for revenge on Zeus, offers to lend her power to his cause. She helps Kratos throughout his journey in hopes that together they can bring about the fall of Olympus. She also acts as the narrator of the game.</li>
                <li>Last Spartan: Kratos first meets the Last Spartan when he climbs out from the Underworld before taking to Pegasus. Kratos tells the Last Spartan to go back to Sparta and prepare the troops for battle. Kratos later encounters the Last Spartan before his battle with the Kraken and unknowingly battles him. When the fight begins, Kratos is unaware that it is his own Spartan lieutenant due to the darkness in the room. The battle is notable for being presented in a 2D-style gameplay. Kratos finishes the battle by throwing the Spartan through the window down to the ground, where he discovers the identity of an already mortally wounded warrior. The Last Spartan tells Kratos that Zeus has destroyed Sparta in Kratos' absence and that he was on a quest to the Sisters of Fate to change Sparta's fate.</li>
                <li>Lahkesis: The middle (matron) of the three Sisters of Fate bears a feathered robe and wings along with a staff. She mocks Kratos by telling him that she was the one responsible for deciding both the defeat of the Titans in the Great War and letting Kratos reach the Sisters. She refuses to accept Kratos and tells him that he will fail in his quest to change his fate.</li>
                <li>Atropos: The oldest (crone) Sister of Fate who was inside Lakhesis until she split off to fight Kratos. She mocked Kratos' attempt to change his fate, demonstrating her power by altering the event from the first God of War and attempting to destroy the Blade of the Gods so that Kratos would die by Ares' hand. Kratos is forced to fight in his own past (with the final battle of the first game raging in the background) in order to defeat her and preserve his existence.</li>
                <li>Clotho: The youngest (maiden) Sisters of Fate that Kratos encounters, although she bears no resemblance to her sisters. She is a morbidly obese silkworm-like creature with multiple arms and breasts that sits within the multi-leveled Loom Chamber. She spins the thread of every mortal, god and titan. Kratos must defeat Clotho and learn how to work the loom in order to kill Zeus and change his fate.</li>
                <li>Zeus: The King of Olympus and the gods who created the Blade of Olympus, and the main antagonist of the game. He is the father of Ares, Athena and Kratos. He betrays Kratos in the beginning of the second game.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Athena's Blades: Magical blades Bestowed on Kratos by the goddess Athena. They function as the same weapon as the Blades of Chaos, but these were given to Kratos as he ascends to Godhood by Athena, and after Ares had taken the Blades of Chaos from Kratos during the final battle in God of War. Weakest of the other weapons, the Blades of Athena are still fast and reliable in close combat.</li>
                <li>Barbarian Hammer: A slow but powerful close combat weapon originally wielded by the Barbarian King. With it, Kratos can deliver powerful slams and smashes, and also summon legions of souls.</li>
