        <P>
            God of War (also known as God of War IV) is the sequel to God of War III as well as a continuation of the canon God of War chronology. God of War is the eighth installment in the franchise overall.
Unlike previous installments, this game focuses on Norse mythology and follows an older and more seasoned Kratos and his new son Atreus in the years since God of War III. The game released on April 20, 2018, and is exclusive to the PlayStation 4. 1. A sequel, God of War: Ragnarök, is in development.

        <p>
            Many years have passed since Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods. Having survived his final encounter with his father Zeus, Kratos has since travelled to Midgard in Ancient Norway and now lives with his young son Atreus in the world of the Norse gods, a savage land inhabited by many ferocious monsters and warriors. In order to teach his son, whose mother (and Kratos's second wife) has recently died, how to survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years and embrace his newfound role as a father and a mentor.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8)" class="blog-subtitle">Weapons</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leviathan Axe: Kratos's primary weapon is a one-handed battle axe with frost magic properties. Leviathan can be immediately recalled by Kratos after being thrown. The axe originally belonged to Faye, a Jötnar and the wife of Kratos and mother of Atreus. The brothers Sindri and Brok crafted the axe long ago and assist Kratos in upgrading it, giving it higher strength and, with the right skills, the ability to freeze and slow down enemies.</li>
                <li>Kratos' Fists: Kratos's uses his fists in unarmed combat and can perform multiple hit combos.</li>
                <li>Talon Bow: Atreus' primary weapon is a magical bow and arrows. The bow has the ability to summon spectral animals to perform attacks and assist Kratos in combat. Later on, it can gain the ability to weaken or shock enemies, among other things when used in various parts of the environment.</li>
                <li>Guardian Shield: Kratos has a gauntlet that transforms into a circular shield for parrying blows and wide-ranged attacks. The shield can be used to block attacks, projectiles, and a well-timed block can parry enemies' attacks. The shield can be upgraded to perform powerful slams and area-of-effect attacks.</li>
                <li>Blades of Chaos: Midway through the game, Kratos returns to his cabin and reclaims his trademark weapon from the previous games. The blades, while weaker, offer wider and faster attacks than the Leviathan Axe to make up for it. They also channel the fire element, making them effective against Hel-Walkers and other enemies resistant to the axe's frost element. Upgrades to them will increase their runic power and give them the ability to burn enemies, sapping their health.</li>
